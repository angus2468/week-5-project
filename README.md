What did we find difficult?
We had issues with old code being pushed on occasion. This was a matter of getting used to working with collaborative push and pulls to github and over time became less of an issue.

What went well?
We worked very cohesively as a team, finding it easy to communicate, plan the project and organise tasks between ourselves so we could also work independently. 
Whenever we had individual issues, we were able to help each other work through them and learn how to fix them.

Things we would like to add in future?
If we continue this project, we would like to add more personalisation to each user. 
This would include better log-in functionality, individual databases, colour theming options and the ability to sort through saved movies/books by genre.
We would also like to work more on our media queries for multiple screen sizes. We would like a more polished look for the mobile view and perhaps to also add queries for tablets and smaller laptop screens.

Planning information:
We would talk daily in our breakout rooms, use discord throughout the day to post important information/links and to communicate outside course hours.

How to set up the project as a new user?

As a new user, you would need to visit https://week-5-project-1.onrender.com/, on load the site will provide a log-in/sign-up form. When you press log in, you will be able to see the checklist, weather and most recent movie/book saved.
The site will also provide a customised hive name in the top left corner.
You can then add new items to each list using the create button at the top which will provide forms for each section.
You can view all saved items through the navigation bar.
